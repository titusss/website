					<p>This physical painting has been created entirely by a machine. It‚Äôs brain was trained for several days on recognizing unique features of human faces and art, until it was capable of creating completely novel portraits. An industrial robot then took acrylic paint on a brush and brought his fantasy on canvas. It changed colors, refreshed paint and cleaned it‚Äôs tool afterwards, with no human intervention.</p>
